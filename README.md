## Installation

Lazy:
```
  { "charlesnicholson/plantuml.nvim" }
```

It starts automatically and runs a server on http://127.0.0.1:8764/. Browse to that page, and it will refresh automatically any time you save, open, or enter a buffer with a filename ending in `.puml`.

## Commands

- `:PlantumlUpdate` - Manually trigger a PlantUML diagram update
- `:PlantumlLaunchBrowser` - Launch browser to view PlantUML diagrams

This was 100% vibe coded but the code doesn't look awful, so whatever. Lots of stuff to improve but the core of it is up and running.

Pull requests welcome.
